# Welding Defects - Image Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting and segmenting welding defects using deep learning techniques. The goal is to automate defect identification in welding images to improve quality control in manufacturing. It has been trained from this dataset https\://universe.roboflow\.com/test-ulmj1/defect-detection-renamed-classes/dataset/4

## Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Deep learning-based segmentation
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Dataset loading and visualization

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/welding-defects-segmentation.git
   cd welding-defects-segmentation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
